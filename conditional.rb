#flow control question 1

(32 * 4) >= 129 #false#

false != !true #false#

true == 4 #true# #got it wrong. I was under the assumption that positive numbers always equaled true.

false == (847 == '874') #true#

(!true || (!(100 / 5) == 20) || ((328 / 4) == 82)) || false #I'm not even sure. The ((  ))  confused me
