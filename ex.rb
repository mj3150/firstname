x = 2 #prints nothing, it just goes to the next line.

puts x = 2 # it puts 2

p name = "Joe" #it puts "Joe"

four = "four" #it puts nothing

print something = "nothing" #it prints the word "nothing" without a line break. I got this question wrong because I thought that it wouldn't have printed anything.
